## Inspiration

The idea for this live wallpaper was born from a moment of quiet reflection—a time when I found myself gazing at the clouds, mesmerized by their delicate, ever-changing forms. In that instant, I wondered what it would be like to capture that beauty and bring it with me wherever I go.

Imagine being able to hold the sky in your hand: the soft, billowing clouds, the gentle shift of colors as the day progresses, and the peaceful ambiance they create. This project is my attempt to translate that ethereal feeling into a digital experience. It’s about more than just aesthetics; it’s about bringing a slice of nature’s magic into the palm of your hand, reminding you that even on the busiest days, there’s beauty overhead.
